The content's all in Dutch.

Compiling the CSS is done with `lessc` which can be installed with
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org)' `npm` utility.  Once installed use the
following command to compile it from the repository's root directory:

    /home/cies/github/node/node_modules/.bin/lessc stylesheets/bootstrap.less > stylesheets/bootstrap.css

**WARNING:** Adjustments to the `.html` file were made, that are not in the `CONTENT.md` file!
